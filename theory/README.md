## Goal
The goal of this project is to write a program able to recognize emotions given facial expressions images and also allowing to predict/recognize new emotions based in a combination of <b>Basic Emotions</b>.

## Studying 
"<i>FER is more difficult than most other Image Classification tasks. However, well-designed systems can achieve accurate results when constraints are taken into account during development.

For example, higher accuracy can be achieved when classifying a smaller subset of highly distinguishable expressions, such as anger, happiness, and fear. Lower accuracy is achieved when classifying larger subsets, or small subsets with less distinguishable expressions, such as anger and disgust.</i>" (https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/recognizing-human-facial-expressions-machine-learning)

<b>Image Preprocess:</b> Can include image transformations such as scaling, cropping, or filtering images. It is often used to accentuate relevant image information, like cropping an image to remove a background. It can also be used to augment a dataset.
